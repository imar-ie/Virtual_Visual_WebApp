# Virtual_Visual_WebApp
Here is the web application
We have 2 tabs 
The first one show the list of the iBeacons in a table (loaded from a json file).
The "delete" button isn't complete because, sometimes, the function add an index in the Json file.
The second tab is a form to add an iBeacon to the list.
It's not complete but the function is approximatly the same as "deleteBeacon"
